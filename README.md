# SC Store – E-Commerce Showcase

SC Store is a simple front-end e-commerce project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to create a functional product showcase where users can browse items, search by name, filter by category, and even add products to a demo cart. It is not a real online store, but it simulates the complete experience of shopping from the front-end perspective.

The website is fully responsive and works on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. Products are displayed in a grid that adapts automatically to the screen size, ensuring a smooth and clear browsing experience on any device. The cart and contact form are demo-only features to show basic interactivity.

This project demonstrates clean layout design, interactive features using JavaScript, and responsive front-end development. It is ideal for showcasing HTML/CSS/JS skills in a project review or academic submission.
